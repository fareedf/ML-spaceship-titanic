# ML-spaceship-titanic

This is a small machine learning project I worked on using the Spaceship Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension based on various features like age, cabin, and spending habits.

Iâ€™m still new to ML, so I focused on getting comfortable with the basics like cleaning data, handling missing values, and building a simple model (Random Forest). I used Google Colab for the whole project.

This was mainly for practice and to start building a portfolio of projects as I get deeper into machine learning. Looking forward to improving it later on as I learn more!
